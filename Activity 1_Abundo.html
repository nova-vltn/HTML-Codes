  <p>A Star Is Born</p>
  <p>As the most fundamental constituents of galaxies, stars are the most well-known astronomical objects. A galaxy's history, dynamics, and development can be inferred from the age, distribution, and makeup of its stars. Furthermore, stars produce and distribute heavy elements like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and the properties of the planetary systems that may form around them are closely related to the properties of stars themselves. As a result, astronomy's primary focus is on the birth, life, and death of stars.</p>

     <b><dt>Main Sequence Stars</dt></b>
    <dd>In a stellar nursery, a mass of gas and dust coalesces to produce a typical star. The cluster begins to spin, heats up, and develops mass over hundreds of millions of years. Nuclear fusion begins when the clump's core reaches temperatures of millions of degrees. 
    </dd>

     <b><dt>Red Giants</dt></b>
    <dd>The energy created by fusion is the only force opposing gravity's pull on matter, thus when a main sequence star with less mass than eight times that of the Sun runs out of hydrogen in its core, it begins to collapse.
    </dd>

     <b><dt>White Dwarfs</dt></b>
    <dd>A red giant's core is all that's left after all of its atmosphere has evaporated. This type of stellar remnant is known as a white dwarf by scientists. Typically the size of Earth, a white dwarf has hundreds of thousands of times the mass of an Earth.
