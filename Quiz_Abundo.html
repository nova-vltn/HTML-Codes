                      <td>In a stellar nursery, a mass of gas and dust coalesces to produce a typical star. The cluster begins to spin, heats up, and develops mass over hundreds of millions of years. Nuclear fusion begins when the clump's core reaches temperatures of millions of degrees. When two protons—the nuclei of hydrogen atoms—combine to generate one helium nucleus, this process takes place. The star is heated by the energy released during fusion, which increases pressure and defies gravity. A star is created.

                      <td>The outer layers of the star expand as hydrogen fusion moves into them. A red giant is the end outcome, seeming more orange than red. The red behemoth eventually loses stability and starts to pulse. It then periodically enlarges and expels portion of its atmosphere. When all of its outer layers eventually blow away, a planetary nebula—an expanding cloud of gas and dust—is created. After almost 5 billion years, the Sun will turn into a red giant.

                      <td>A white dwarf cools over billions of years because it cannot produce any new heat. White dwarfs, despite their name, can produce visible light in a spectrum of colors, from red to blue-white. Sometimes, dusty disks of matter, debris, and even planets—remains of the parent star's red giant phase—are discovered to surround white dwarfs by scientists. The Sun will transition from a red giant to a white dwarf in roughly 10 billion years.

                      <td>Although certain white dwarfs can be discovered in binary systems with a plainly visible main sequence star, white dwarfs are too faint to be seen with the naked eye. Canis Minor, a constellation in the north, has Procyon B as an example.
