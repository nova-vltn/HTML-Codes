        <p><abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr> 
            brought together the world's scientific research community, communication networks, training, engineering, and development facilities, <br>
            numerous launch vehicles, worldwide dispersed launch and flight operations, and multinational flight crews. <br>
            The station was created in the years 1984–1993. Starting in the late 1980s, stations' components were being <br>
            built in the US, Canada, Japan, and Europe.

        A Record of Ingenuity
        NASA has explored the uncharted since its founding in 1958 by pushing the frontiers of science and technology.

        NASA advanced the work already underway on robotic and human spaceflight when it opened for operation on October 1, 1958, and during the following 65 years, 
        it has persisted in pushing the frontiers of space exploration and aviation.

        On May 3, 2021, Sen. Bill Nelson took the oath of office as the 14th Administrator of NASA, charged with implementing the policies and plans of the    
    <samp>Biden-Harris administration.</samp> Nelson was a US service member. Florida served in the Senate for eighteen years, and in 1986, the space shuttle flight 61-C included a payload specialist.
